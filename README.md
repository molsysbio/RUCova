## RUCova: Removal of Unwanted Covariance in mass cytometry data
Here we present the R package RUCova, a novel method designed to address confounding factors such as heterogeneous cell size and staining efficiency in mass cytometry data. RUCova  removes unwanted covariance using multivariate linear regression on Surrogates of Unwanted Covariance (SUCs), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
